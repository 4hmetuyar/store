## What is NGXS?
NGXS is a state management pattern + library for Angular. It acts as a single source of
truth for your application's state, providing simple rules for predictable state mutations.

NGXS is modeled after the CQRS pattern popularly implemented in libraries like Redux and NGRX
but reduces boilerplate by using modern TypeScript features such as classes and decorators.
